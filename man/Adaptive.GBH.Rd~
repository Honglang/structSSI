\title{
Adaptive Group Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure
}
\description{
Performs the Group Benjamini-Hochberg procedure using adaptive estimates
of the proportions of p-values in given groups.
}
\usage{
Adaptive.GBH(unadj.p, groups, alpha, method)
}

\arguments{
  \item{unadj.p}{
A vector of the unadjusted p-values resulting from a multiple testing
  experiment.
}
  \item{groups}{
A vector of the same length as the vector of unadjusted p-values, where
an 'i' in the jth coordinate indicates that the jth unadjusted p-values
  in \code{unadj.p} belongs to group i.
}
  \item{alpha}{
The level of that we are attempting to control the FDR at.
}
  \item{method}{
The method for adaptively estimating the proportion of true null
  hypotheses within a vector of unadjusted p-values. The possible
  options are "storey", "lsl", and "tst". See the documentation for
  \code{estimatePi0} for more details.
}
}

\details{
  The procedure implemented here is described in more detail in the paper
  by Hu, Zhao, and Zhou JASA 2011.
}

\value{
  A list where the first element orders the hypotheses according to
  their unadjusted p-values and the second element displays the
  hypotheses in order of their adjusted p-values.
